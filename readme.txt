Welcome to BikeRacer!
by autumn! https://github.com/FallBestSeason

this game is about building and racing fixed gear bikes on criterium tracks
the bikes are customizable, with different parts providing different pros and cons
inspired by: 
    -the gun building of escape from tarkov
	-the gameplay loop of forza motorsport 3
	-customization mechanics in FR legends
	-my love for the bikes :)

RACE (CONTROLS):
you move the character forward by pressing W
lean side to side with the A and D keys
press SPACE to enter a skid, which will behave differently based on what direction
you are leaning when you press space.

Leaning, skidding, and accelerating all have inertia systems.

I am making this game to get better at coding. 
It was made on a language and framework I have zero experience with.

all art is made by me in pixelorama, a free open-source editor written in godot. I am not good at UI or art so please look at the pretty code instead :)
