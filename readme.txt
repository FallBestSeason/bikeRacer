Welcome to BikeRacer!
by autumn! https://github.com/FallBestSeason

this game is about building and racing fixed gear bikes on criterium tracks
the bikes are customizable, with different parts providing different pros and cons
inspired by: 
    -the gameplay loop and car upgrading of forza motorsport 3 
    -somehow mario kart got in here
    -the gun building of escape from tarkov
    -the customization of FR legends
    -my love of fixed gear bikes and the scene

GAME MECHANICS:
MAIN MENU:
here you can select from three options
"enter shop" takes you to your personal bike shop
"credits" will open the credits (some day)
"quit" closes the application

SHOP:
your "shop" for changing your build. 
Any parts you purchase will be accessible here.
Use the buttons on the bottom to open context menus with different parts in them
Different parts will affect your build in different ways! 

RACE (CONTROLS):
you move the character forward by pressing W
lean side to side with the A and D keys
press SPACE to enter a skid, which will behave differently based on what direction
you are leaning when you press space. (akira slide that thang)
Leaning, skidding, and accelerating all have inertia systems.

I am making this game to get better at coding. 
The goal of this project is to prove that I can function as a full-stack dev on
a framework and language I know nothing about. 

all art is made by me in pixelorama, a free open-source editor written in godot.
