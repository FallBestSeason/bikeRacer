current:
more parts + logic for bike visualizer
make json list of all items, contains name, cat
figure out implementation of frame transparency
    either each frame needs to have two paths somehow
    or each frame needs to have to item names and textures
    or no more rear frame lols

todo:

races

figure out atribute system and how it will relate to races

remove items in inventory manager
inventory manager cleanup

could mainmenu and bike shop share an inference module?
    what is cost benefit
    they need hella cleaning up regardless

bikeshop cleanup, comments need redone
    addbutton method? lots of repeat calls to vars and similar math
    also just a big mess, maybe could use abstracted into smaller parts
    as part of shared inference module upgrade?

fix god awful optimization between inventorymanager and bikeshop,
reads through every item in players inventory every frame
will require restructuring in bikeshop and rewrite of acess methods
in inventoryManager and bike classes

implement dirty squares in gui screens?
assuming it will be needed for game screens

test + fix screen size reactivity
test tertiary list long enough to go up bikeshop

main menu kinda just need a rewrite lmao
