current:
frame tertiary dosent go left

todo:

races

figure out atribute system and how it will relate to races

remove items in inventory manager
inventory manager cleanup + comments

could mainmenu and bike shop share an inference module?
    what is cost benefit
    they need hella cleaning up regardless

bikeshop cleanup, comments need redone
    addbutton method? lots of repeat calls to vars and similar math
    also just a big mess, maybe could use abstracted into smaller parts
    as part of shared inference module upgrade?

fix god awful optimization between inventorymanager and bikeshop,
reads through every item in players inventory every frame
will require restructuring in bikeshop and rewrite of acess methods
in inventoryManager and bike classes

implement dirty squares in gui screens?
assuming it will be needed for game screens

test + fix screen size reactivity

main menu kinda just need a rewrite lmao

fix bug where indexoutofrange if you leave the shop, come back in, select a button
