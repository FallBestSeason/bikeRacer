fix god awful optimization between inventorymanager and bikeshop,
reads through every item in players inventory every frame
will require restructuring in bikeshop and rewrite of acess methods
in inventoryManager and bike classes

implement dirty squares in gui screens?

test + fix screen size reactivity
you cant make me, what if it's 1280x720 in an artistic, comment on the early internet period kinda way

rewrite of bikeshop to get rid of lots of hard coded pixel values

update readme

customizable mechanics:
not meant to be realistic, meant to make building fun
front tooth count and rear tooth cound will affect acceleration and top speed
lighter components will make the bike lean side to side faster
heavier components will make the bike skid for longer (decelrate less?)
goal: large noticable difference in handling between heaviest and lightest bike, 
   should be able to feel the difference in one or two parts worth of upgrades

feature completeness:
player sprites change based on bike build
riding attributes updated by build
particle system working correctly
particles or some kind of feedback for higher speed / accel after skid
grass collisions
laps / checkpoints
timer
points system for skids
rating based on those?
other maps
map selector screen
player sprite rendered on map selector screen
